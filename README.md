# Banking-Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervised-Analysis-using-PCA-K-Means
Banking customer segmentation using PCA and K-Means clustering. Identifies 4 customer segments with detailed profiling and variance analysis, exported to Excel.  

Project Overview

This project performs unsupervised analysis on banking customer data to create meaningful segments. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering, the project identifies patterns and categorizes customers into distinct groups based on behavior and financial activity.

The final output includes 4 clusters, labeled for easier interpretation:

High_Spender

Dormant_Users

Impulse_Buyer

Cash_Reliant_Credit_Holder

Installment_Loyalist

The clusters are also profiled in detail and exported to an Excel file showing feature importance and variance.

Key Features

PCA: Reduce dimensionality and capture maximum variance.

K-Means Clustering: Identify natural groupings in the data.

Silhouette & Inertia Charts: Evaluate clustering performance.

Cluster Profiling: Generate descriptive statistics for each segment.

Excel Export: Profiling table and feature importance saved for reporting.


Key Insights

4 customer segments identified with distinct characteristics.

PCA reduced dimensionality while preserving most variance for clustering.

Silhouette and inertia charts confirm the clustering quality.

Profiling highlights spending patterns, account activity, and financial behavior for each segment.
